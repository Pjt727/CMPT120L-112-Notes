# Notes for CMPT 120L-112

## Access to the notes
- Clone the repository to your computer
- Sync with main to get updated notes (just like how we would sync to get the updated lab)
* I cannot see who clones the repo even if you are logged in

## Note Format
- The notes are formatted as one file for each week
- The file format is juniper notebook in python so you can view and execute the code with formatted notes from the professor in the same file
- Sometimes I link keywords or functions to the documentation on python
