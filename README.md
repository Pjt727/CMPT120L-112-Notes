# Notes for CMPT 120L-112

## Access to the notes
- Clone the repository to your computer
- Sync with main to get updated notes (sort of like how we would sync to get the updated lab)
* I cannot see who clones the repo even if you are logged in

## Note Format
- The notes are formatted as one file for each week
- The file format is juniper notebook in python so you can view and execute the code with formatted notes from the professor in the same file
- Sometimes I link keywords or functions to the documentation on python

## Misc
- if you have any questions about the notes or code you can email me at patrick.tyler1@marist.edu
- if you want to fix any typos, unclear explantations, bad practice, mistakes, etc in my code or notes
   you can make a branch of the repo with the mistake(s) and then submit a pull request

- This is a good video on how to make pull requests: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFCM-PC3cu8
    - the video uses git bash but you can do the same things with GitHub desktop if you prefer
